## App
- The app is based on [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org).
- It consists of a Chatbot that sells time to prospective buyers
- Buyers get a certificate and a link to a webpage that shows sand for the amount of time the buyer bought
- Pushes to the `main` branch will automatically be deployed to the test environment at Netlify https://timesalesltd.netlify.app
